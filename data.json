Actually, failure is a very essential step of procedure on the journey to success. If you do not fail and get adapted to it, you can never do well in life.\"\r\nOverall, he is one person I genuinely look upto and really inspires me with his overall personality.\r\nAnother very fascinating thing about him is that in his LinkedIn profile under the education sector, he mentions Internet and no other educational degree because he is of the opinion that that's the only thing that matters- your own learning, skill set and application that you develop on your own without any external aid.\r\n",

It made possible what was truly impossible.\r\nCurrency is something that has been in practice since hundreds of years and due to internet and the advent of cryptocurrency and blockchain, currency is on the verge of becoming an outdated concept.\r\nHad Edward Lytton got an opportunity to rephrase his famous saying, it would most definitely have been -\r\n\"Internet is mightier than the sword.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
